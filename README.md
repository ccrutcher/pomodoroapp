This is a study aid developed to give users greater control over their pomodoro study timer. This was primarily intended for personal use to be able to change the parameters of the study technique.

What is the Pomodoro Technique? Wikipedia has this to say: 
"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student."

After three short breaks, users take a longer break to more fully refresh and prime the brain to learn more when they resume work.

Users can set the duration of their work, break, and long-break periods. Once the timer has been started, a random motivational quote will appear, and over time will change to different motivational messages. At the end of each work, break, and long break period, a bell sound will play to inform the user to change their current action. Users can also pause and resume the timer.
